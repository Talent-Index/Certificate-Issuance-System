# Foundry Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Successfully Completed

This document summarizes the successful migration from Hardhat to Foundry for the Certificate Issuance System.

### 🚀 Deployed Contracts (Avalanche Fuji Testnet)

1. **CertificateIssuanceSystem**: `0xb90c5B3fE62f463AF697B6bC53ac579b0B2f0F2A`
   - Main certificate management contract with role-based access control
   - Supports certificate issuance, revocation, and transfers

2. **OrganizationNFTCertificate**: `0xdE5b750ebBc0A92a53614f18081E72609F09BC69`
   - NFT-based certificate with organization branding support
   - ERC721 compliance with custom metadata

### 📁 Project Structure Changes

#### Removed Hardhat Files
- ✅ `package.json` (root level)
- ✅ `hardhat.config.ts`
- ✅ `node_modules/` directory
- ✅ `package-lock.json`
- ✅ Old deployment scripts in `Scripts/Deploy.ts`

#### Added Foundry Files
- ✅ `foundry.toml` - Foundry configuration
- ✅ `lib/` directory with dependencies
  - `lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` - OpenZeppelin smart contract library
  - `lib/forge-std/` - Foundry standard library
- ✅ `script/Deploy.s.sol` - Foundry deployment script
- ✅ `out/` directory - Compiled contract artifacts

#### Updated Contract Structure
- ✅ Moved contracts from `contracts/` to `src/`
- ✅ Fixed OpenZeppelin import paths for Foundry compatibility
- ✅ Updated ReentrancyGuard import from `security/` to `utils/` (OpenZeppelin v5)

### 🔧 Configuration Updates

#### Frontend Configuration
- ✅ Updated `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `frontend/avacertify-v2/utils/contractConfig.ts`
- ✅ Contract ABI already properly configured for the deployed contract

#### Environment Setup
- ✅ Private key configured with `0x` prefix
- ✅ Snowtrace API key configured for contract verification

### 🛠️ Build System

#### Foundry Configuration (`foundry.toml`)
```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

[rpc_endpoints]
fuji = "https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc"

[etherscan]
fuji = { key = "${SNOWTRACE_API_KEY}", url = "https://api-testnet.snowtrace.io/api" }
```

#### Key Commands
- **Build**: `forge build`
- **Test**: `forge test`
- **Deploy**: `forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url fuji --broadcast --verify`

### 📊 Deployment Results

```
OrganizationNFTCertificate deployed at: 0xdE5b750ebBc0A92a53614f18081E72609F09BC69
CertificateIssuanceSystem deployed at: 0xb90c5B3fE62f463AF697B6bC53ac579b0B2f0F2A

Gas Used: 4,552,291 gas
Total Cost: 0.000000000009104582 ETH
```

### 🔍 Verification Status
- ✅ Contracts deployed successfully
- ⚠️ Snowtrace verification failed due to API key rate limits
- ✅ Contract functions available and accessible on testnet

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Frontend is now configured to use the new contract address
2. **Testing**: Verify certificate issuance functionality through the dashboard
3. **API Integration**: Backend services can interact with the new contract addresses
4. **Manual Verification**: Can manually verify contracts on Snowtrace if needed

### 📚 Contract Features

#### CertificateIssuanceSystem
- Role-based access control (Admin, Issuer roles)
- Certificate issuance with recipient name and owner
- Certificate revocation by authorized users
- Certificate ownership transfer
- Certificate verification
- Reentrancy protection

#### OrganizationNFTCertificate
- ERC721 NFT compliance
- Organization branding with logo and colors
- Role-based minting permissions
- Metadata URI support for certificates

### 🔐 Security Features
- OpenZeppelin AccessControl for role management
- ReentrancyGuard for protection against reentrancy attacks
- Proper access controls for sensitive functions
