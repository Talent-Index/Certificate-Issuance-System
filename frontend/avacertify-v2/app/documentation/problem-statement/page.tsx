          <p className="mb-4">Current certificate verification systems suffer from several major inefficiencies:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              Time-Consuming Manual Verification: Employers and institutions must contact issuers to verify credentials,
              leading to delays and inefficiencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fraud and Counterfeits: The rise of fake certificates undermines the value of genuine credentials, costing
              businesses and institutions billions of dollars annually.
            </li>
            <li>
              Centralized Vulnerabilities: Traditional systems are controlled by single entities, making them prone to
              manipulation, hacks, and data breaches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limited Global Accessibility: Many systems are regionally siloed, making it hard for international
              employers to verify credentials efficiently.
